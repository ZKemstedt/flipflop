  Loggs will be stored in a database


### Secondary plugins
* DiscordSRV
  [link](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/)
  > Using this plugin, you are able to give players the ability to chat in-game to chat with players on your Discord server as well as having people on the Discord server be able to chat with people on the server- this is useful for the situation of someone not being at their computer and being able to talk in-game.
  > As well as that, this plugin also has a remote console feature.
